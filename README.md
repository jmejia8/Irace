# Irace (wrapper) for Julia

You can configure your algorithms (hyper-parameters optimization) by using the Irace
package written in R.

## Installation

If your are using a windows OS, good look, I don't know if this wrapper is compatible.
However, if your are using some linux-based OS:

1. Install R
2. Open the R REPL and write `install.packages("irace")`

Now, you are able to install Irace in julia: Open the julia REPL and type `]`

```
Pkg> 
```
